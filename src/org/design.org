* Following features are supported

  Components:
  - Lab Pages
    - Build
    - Deployment
  - Experiments
    - Build
    - Deployment
      
** Lab Building

   The lab pages are built using the following things:
	 1. Page templates
	 3. Lab Descriptor
	    
   The figure below depicts the process of building a page using data
   from lab descriptor and templates.

**** Page Configuration

     To generate a page, we need to know the template to use, and the
     name of the resulting html page. The =Page Configuration=
     contains this information.

     |-----------+---------------------------------|
     | Field     | Description                     |
     |-----------+---------------------------------|
     | Heading   | Content Heading to be displayed |
     | Tempalate | The Template to be used         |
     | Outfn     | Name of the generated html page |
     |-----------+---------------------------------|

     

***** Why not derive the page name from the template name?

      Template file-name to generated file-name is not a one-to-one
      mapping.  More than one template names map to a one target page.
      
      Example:

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	NestedListOfExperiments.handlebars => ListOfExperiments.html
	ListOfExperiments.handlebars => ListOfExperiments.html      
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      
**** Page Templates

     Page templates are html templates written in a templating
     language.

     Following templates are defined:
     1. Skeleton
     2. Introduction
     3. Objective
     4. ListOfExperiments
     5. NestedListOfExperiments
     6. TargetAudience

***** Skeleton

      The =skeleton.handlebars= template is used to build the page
      structure that is common for each of the Lab pages.

***** Pages

****** Introduction

       Content: Single Paragraph of text
       
****** Objective
       
       Single paragraph of text

****** List Of Experiments

******* Nested List       
       
	Array of Experiments objects

******* Flat List
	
	Array of experiment sections

****** Target Audience
       
       UG, PG

****** Feedback

       fixed content


** Experiment Building

   An experiment can be of two types:
     
   1. IIITH Experiment
   2. Phase III Markdown-authored Experiment


   Each type of experiment has a different build process.  The build
   process for each kind of experiment is described below.
     
*** IIITH Experiment

    Each IIITH Experiment is located in a gitlab repository.  The
    build process involves cloning the repository and running make.
    This creates a build/ folder in the repository which contains
    the working experiment.

      
*** Phase III Markdown-authored Experiment

    A =Phase 3 - Markdown Authored experiment= is an experiment that
    follows the IITB Experiment development model.  This experiment
    sits in a private gitlab repository and the repository only
    contains experiment specific content.  Additional processing
    needs to be performed to generate experiment pages in the form
    of Phase-3 UI.

    After the build process the experiment resides in a predefined
    location.

      
** Deployment

   Deployment is the process of copying the builds to a given
   location in a publically accessible server.

   Assumtions: 
   - The script is executed on the same machine that would be
     hosting the labs and experiments.
   - The builds are available on the same machine.
   - Verifying the hosted url is not possible (technical
     considerations of reverse proxy)
