#+title: Requirements

* Interface Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: interface-requirements
  :END:

1. The system should provide a command line interface to the user with
   the following commands: =init=, =run=
2. The =init= command, given the path to a local lab repository should
   generate a json file (called =lab-descriptor.json=) with placeholders
   for all fields required for building and deploying a lab and its
   experiments.
3. The =run= command, given the path to a local lab repository should
   build and deploy the lab and all its experiments using the json file
   (=lab-descriptor.json=) available in the local repository.

* Process Requirements

  The user should be able to perform the following processes.  The
  general usage flow is described in the figure below.

  [[../img/Process_Flow.png]]

** Initialize
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: initialize
   :END:

 The lab and experiment building and deployment process requires a
 *lab-descriptor* json file that describes the lab and all its
 experiments. To help the user get started with populating the json file,
 the initialize process should create a sample json file in the local lab
 repository containing all the required fields.

** Run
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: run
   :END:

 This process should build and deploy all the experiments and the lab
 using the *lab-descriptor* json file available in the local lab
 repository.

*** Lab Pages to be generated
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: lab
    :END:

 A lab is described by the following fields: 
   - Name 
   - Discipline 
   - Discipline URL 
   - Host 
   - Phase 
   - Experiments 
   - College 
   - Introduction 
   - Objective (Optional) 
   - Target Audience 
   - Course Alignment

 The Following Pages should be generated: 
   - /Introduction.html/ 
   - /ListOfExperiments.html/ 
   - /Objective.html/ (Optional: Only if the objective is defined in the descriptor) 
   - /TargetAudience.html/ 
   - /CourseAlignment.html/ 
   - /Feedback.html/

 Each page should display the following (lab specific) information: 
 - Discipline (with link to discipline home page) 
 - Lab Name 
 - Navigation links to each page listed above

*** Experiments to be suported
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: experiments
    :END:

 The experiments in a lab are described in the lab-descriptor json file.
 The following informatioin is available for each experiment:

 - Name
 - Short Name
 - Repository URL
 - Tag
 - Kind

**** Kinds of Experiments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: kinds-of-experiments
     :END:

 The system should support build and deployment of the following two
 kinds of experiments. 1. IIITH Experiments 2. Phase 3 Markdown
 Experiments

 Each kind of experiment has a different build process which is described
 in the related experiment project repository.

* Functional Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: functional-requirements
  :END:

** Lab
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: lab-1
   :END:

1. Using the lab descriptor json file the system should generate lab
   pages.
2. The generated pages should be deployed to the appropriate public
   server if the following conditions are satisfied:

1) The lab pages are generated successfuly.
2) All the experiments in the lab (described in the json) are built and
   deployed successfully.

3. If the lab is deployed, the lab descriptor should be updated to
   contain the appropriate version number of the lab (derived from the
   latest version) and a new tag should be released with the same
   version number.
4. Print the generated lab's URL and Version number to a log file.

** Experiments
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: experiments-1
   :END:

1. All the experiments described in the json should be built and
   deployed.
2. If any of experiment fails during build or deployment the system
   should not deploy any of the experiments.
3. Print the list of all the deployed experiments with their URLs and
   versions to a log file.
